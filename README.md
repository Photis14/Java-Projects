## Introduction

The purpose of this collection is to provide a comprehensive set of examples that illustrate the versatility and power of Java in solving various problems, from simple console applications to more complex data manipulation and algorithms.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several folders, each focusing on a specific area of Java programming:

- Basic Java Concepts (Arrays, Classes, Loops, etc.)
- Data Structures (Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Hashes, Queues, Stacks)
- Algorithms (Searching, Sorting, Recursion, etc.)
- Advanced Topics (Geometry, Math Library, and more)

## Getting Started

To run these projects, you will need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK), version 8 or later.
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VSCode with Java support.

Clone this repository to your local machine, navigate to any project folder, and compile the Java files using the JDK. For example:

```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
```
